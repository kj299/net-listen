# net-listen
/* listens to both TCP and UDP connections and allows the user to specify the port and IP address.
You can compile this code using gcc and run it with two arguments: port number for TCP and port number for UDP. For example:
gcc network.c -o network
./network 1234 5678
This will listen to incoming connections on port number `1234` for TCP and `5678` for UDP. If you do not provide two arguments when running this program it will print a usage message
add  help if the user does not add the required variables.
